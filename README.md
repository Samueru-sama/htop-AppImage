# htop-AppImage
AppImage of htop. 

WHY? Well btop releases binaries and htop doesn't, the appimage is just a different method of having released binaries, plus it ships with an icon and .desktop file as a single file.

-------------------------------------------

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, I recommend this alternative instead: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

This appimage works without `fuse2` as it can use `fuse3` instead.
